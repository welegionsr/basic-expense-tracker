For practicing C++ and OOP

Project: "Mini Expense Tracker"


Problem Statement:

Design and implement a simple console-based expense tracker in C++. The program should allow a user to:

    Add an expense with a category (e.g., "Food", "Transport", etc.) and an amount.
    View expenses by category, showing a total sum for each category.
    View all expenses sorted by the amount (descending order).
    Exit the program safely, with a farewell message.

Requirements:

    Use OOP principles: at least one class (e.g., Expense or ExpenseManager).
    Handle input validation: prevent invalid entries (e.g., negative amounts, empty categories).
    Maintain clean, readable code with comments where necessary.
    Bonus: Implement an option to export the expense list to a file in a simple text format (e.g., expenses.txt).

Expectations:

    You'll submit the code and a short README (or a paragraph) explaining your design choices and how to run the program.
    No need for a database or external librariesâ€”just stick to STL for any data structures.
